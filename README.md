# Tic Tac Toe!


This is a coded version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game which is usually played as a pastime in schools(haha!). Coded completely in C++, I have stuck with using the fundamentals of this language, i.e, for and while loops, a few boolean functions and a 2D array.
The game is to be played between two players 1 and 2, wherein player 1 is the 'x' and player 2 is the 'o'. The players enter the co-ordinate of the grid in which they want to place their respective symbols.
The playing space is a 3x3 matrix which is comprised of a 2D array.
Logical functions called 'userWins' and 'user2Wins' check whether a straight line comprising of three concurrent values is found or not for both the symbols respectively. Also this status (1 if the function is true, and 0 if the fuunction is false) is displayed after each entry into the matrix.
If either of the user wins, the game is concluded and winner is announced.
